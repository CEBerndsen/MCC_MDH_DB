Cytoplasmic MDH1 Uniprot ID: P40925 Variation: 278p

Description Aspartic acid 278 of MDH1 was phosphorylated and analyzed the effects on the function and structure of PTM modified protein.

# Part 1 from Project 4 report outline (with citations as appropriate)

1.  image of the mimic variant model showing residue 278 is located on a loop with hydrogen bonding to arginine and asparagine. ![alt text](images/mimicWI.png)

2.  image of the PTM modified model showing residue 278 with hydrogen bonds to arginine, asparagine, and valine. ![alt text](images/PTM_modified_model_WI.png)

3.  image of the unmodified protein model shows residue 278 with hydrogen bonds to leucine and valine.\

## Effect of the sequence variant and PTM on MDH dynamics

Part 3 from the Project 4 report

1.  Image of the visualization of PTM modified protein model (pink) and mimic variant model (red) ![alt text](images/PTM_model_Mimic_model.png)

2.  Annotated RMSF plot showing differences between the simulations ![alt text](images/rmsf.png)

3.  Annotated plots of pKa for the key amino acids ![alt text](images/pKa_plot.png)

4.  If needed, show ligand bound images and how modification affects substrate binding

Description of the data and changes

## Comparison of the mimic and the authentic PTM

Part 4 from the Project 4 report outline include images as needed 1. Image of the visualization of PTM modified protein model (pink) and mimic variant model (red) indicated the mimic replicated the PTM modified model.\
