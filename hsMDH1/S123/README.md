# Malate Dehydrogenase 1 (MDH1)

# Uniprot ID: P40925

# Variation: phosphorylation of S123

## Description

Serine 123 of human MDH1 was identified as a post-translationally
modified (PTM) site in several large-scale PTM studies, including
UniProt entry P40926 (1). With this being said, there is limited direct
evidence on how this modification affects the MDH1 structure or
function. S123 is located in a loop region near the protein surface, but
not within the active site.

Description of the data and changes

The pS123 in human MDH1 introduced a bulky, negatively charged phosphate
group that formed strong electrostatic interactions with the lysines
nearby. This helped stabilize the surrounding loop and reduce its
flexibility. The S123D variant increased loop mobility due to the weaker
interactions. The MD Google Colab Steps (2) confirmed greater
flexibility in the variant, as well as reduced pKa for the active site
histidine.

## Comparison of the mimic and the authentic PTM

While both pS123 and S123D introduced a negative charge at the same
location, their structural and dynamic consequences differed. The PTM
created a stronger interaction network and more rigid conformation due
to the phosphate's charge and size. The variant replicated some of these
aspects but lacked the interaction network and steric effects, making it
a partial and imperfect substitute.
