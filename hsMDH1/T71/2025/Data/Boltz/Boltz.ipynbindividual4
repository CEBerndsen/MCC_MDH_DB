With new methods such as [AlphaFold3](https://alphafoldserver.com/welcome) and the ever expanding structural data in the [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/), it is possible to (cautiously) model these complexes. Additionally, resources such as Google Colab (you are in one!) allow for greater access to these methods in scientific study.\n","\n","**[Boltz-1](https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz)** is a modeling algorithem built on AlphaFold3 that results in similar prediction quality. So why use it? The current iteration of the AlphaFold3 server (as of 2025) is highly restrained in the modeling options such as post-translational modifications and ligands. Boltz-1 has fewer restrictions on the options allowing for greater opportunity to model complexes.\n","This colab runs a version of Boltz-1 and reduces the input complexity to allow modeling of protein-ligand complexes. It is an adaptation of the notebook generated by the [Colabfold](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold) group to make is accessible in the biochemistry classroom.\n","\n","##**Please make a copy of this colab for your personal use!!**\n","\n","A few things to start:\n","\n","1.

Clicking the \"play\" button to the top left of a code block runs the code. Sometimes you can see the code and interact with it.
