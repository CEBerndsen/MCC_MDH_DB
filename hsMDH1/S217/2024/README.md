# P40925
# PTM phosphoserine and variant aspartic acid


## Description

The modification site, amino acid 217, in human malate dehydrogenase 1, has been researched and described before. In human MDH1, the amino acid at 217 is normally serine. In a particular example from UniProt, the serine at amino acid placement 217 was changed to an isoleucine.
