Human Malate Dehydrogenase (MDH) Uniprot ID: P40925

Phosphorylation of S217 Description:

Serine 217 of human MDH is the site of a post-translational modification, phosphorylation. As a result, a phosphate group was added, changing the structure of serine, along with the interactions and function of this enzyme. There is no previous literature on this specific modification site.

Description of the data and changes:

Images of the modification site with the unmodified, PTM mimic, and modified enzyme superposed are provided. This depicts the specific changes at the modification site. The PDB files produced by the molecular dynamics colab step 1 are also provided, showing structural differences. The RMSF plot and pKa charts were produced in molecular dynamic colab step 2, providing detail on the function of the PTM mimic.
