# Human MDH2

# Uniprot ID: P40926

# Variation: phosphorylation of S251

## Description

This project investigates a previously uncharacterized
post-translational modification (PTM) site at residue 250 of human
mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2), where the native serine
(SER250) was either phosphorylated or substituted with aspartic acid
(ASP250) as a mimic. Although no prior studies have focused on this
specific site, its proximity to the NAD⁺ binding residue MET251 and a
flexible loop involved in substrate access suggests that changes here
may influence cofactor binding and enzymatic activity. Structural
modeling and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that both the mimic
and phosphorylated forms alter local interactions, potentially affecting
the conformational flexibility required for catalytic efficiency and
cofactor turnover.

Description of the data and changes

Structural and dynamic analysis of the unmodified, mimic (ASP250), and
modified (SEP250) MDH2 models revealed notable differences across
multiple datasets. Alignment of the models showed altered bonding
patterns near residue 250, with the modified model forming more
extensive hydrogen bonds than the mimic, suggesting increased local
rigidity. RMSF analysis demonstrated that the mimic variant exhibited
elevated flexibility throughout the protein, particularly near the
N-terminus and residue \~330, indicating reduced structural stability.
pKa calculations revealed a decrease in the active site histidine
(HIS200) pKa in the mimic model, which may disrupt catalytic proton
transfer. Ligand-binding analysis showed that while neither SER250 nor
ASP250 directly contacted NAD⁺ or NADH, nearby MET251 interacted weakly
with both cofactors. The mimic's negative charge and increased
flexibility near this site may indirectly alter cofactor binding
dynamics, potentially impacting enzymatic function.

Comparison of the mimic and authentic PTM

Comparative analysis shows that while the ASP250 mimic partially
reflects the effects of phosphorylation at residue 250 in MDH2, it does
not fully replicate the structural or functional impact of authentic
phosphoserine. The modified model forms more extensive hydrogen bonding
networks and shows increased rigidity near the NAD⁺ binding pocket,
whereas the mimic displays fewer interactions and greater flexibility.
RMSF data support this, with higher fluctuations in the mimic structure,
particularly near residue 250. Additionally, pKa analysis reveals a
decrease in the active site histidine for the mimic, suggesting altered
protonation dynamics. Overall, the mimic introduces only a partial
approximation of the electrostatic and conformational effects caused by
phosphorylation, and may not accurately reflect its full regulatory
role.
