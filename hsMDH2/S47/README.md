## Description

This study aimed to investigate post-translational modifications on human malate dehydrogenase 2. Specifically observing the possible effects of serin 47 phosphorylation compared to post-translational modification mimitry.Serine 47 of human MDH2 had not been identified as a post-translationally modified site before this project and there have been no functional studies of the role of this site in human metabolism. Serine 47 is located in the N-terminal region of hMDH2, in a loop structure. This loop is situated near the dimerization interface, which is crucial for the enzyme’s function. My modification site is near amino acids: phosphoserine, Leucine, and valine.
