        "# **Introduction**\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to the world of Molecular Dynamics! This lesson is here to teach you the basic protocol of running a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, including a bit of Python coding. If you don't know how to code, don't worry! These lessons assume no prior knowledge of code or Python. The main purpose of this colab is to provide a short, educational molecular dynamics simulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is molecular dynamics?\n",
        "Molecular dynamics or MD is a computational approach that simulates the movements of molecules. Typically we are simulating the motions of one molecule to illustrate and understand how populations of this molecule behave in laboratory or cellular environments. The theoretical underpinnings of MD are based in statistical mechanics and predicting the motions of spheres. As knowledge of chemical systems advanced and computers became more accessible, the spheres have become more molecular and information like hydrogen bonding and charges are included. Wikipedia has a good [timeline and description of MD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why is MD useful?\n",
        "Molecules are in motion! While we frequently say structure determines function, that is a bit of an oversimplification. A more complete description is that structure determines how the molecule moves which determines properties and function. The movements of molecules are connected to forming interactions with ligands and cofactors, catalytic activity, and other chemical properties. Thus a structure is a picture of a horse, while MD is a movie of the horse racing showing how fast the horse is and how each part of the horse is involved in winning the race.\n",
        "\n",
        "[Short introductory video](https://www.loom.com/share/e3ed804926874bf4ab1f8025ddb5be12?sid=997813cd-9653-4fd5-bfc8-6e2e3dd361a6)\n",
        "\n",
        "From this fundamental description, it is then possible to model how changes in the protein structure from ligand binding or sequence changes or post-translational modification affect the dynamics and function of the molecule.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What will I get from this Colab?\n",
        "This colab does the simulation and provides the files that form the \"movie\" of the motions of your molecule. In [further colabs](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gsqVx570FsOm7-aDZNslvHc4Kkq2Gp1v?usp=sharing), you will analyze the fundamental motions of your molecule.\n",
