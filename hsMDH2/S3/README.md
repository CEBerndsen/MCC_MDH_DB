# Human MDH2
# Uniprot ID: P40926
# Variation: Phosphorylation of Ser 3


## Description

Serine 3 is located at the very beginning of the amino acid sequence of human MDH2 on an alpha loop, also called a tail (Figure 1). The modified residue is distant from the dimer interface, substrate binding site, and the active site. This is due to it being located on the alpha loop instead of the main structure.
