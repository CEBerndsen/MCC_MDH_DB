# Human mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase

# Uniprot ID: P40926

# Variation: phosphorylation of T73 (T49 in structure)

## Description

# Threonine 73 of human MDH2 (P40926) has been identified as a phosphorylation site in proteomics studies, but no functional characterization of this modification has been published (1). The site was not discussed in previous structural or enzymatic analyses of MDH2, and its biological significance remains unknown. This threonine residue corresponds to position 49 in the mature, processed enzyme and is located on a loop at the dimer interface. There are currently no reports linking phosphorylation at this site to changes in malate dehydrogenase function, redox balance, or disease.

## Effect of the sequence variant and PTM on MDH dynamics

3.  Annotated RMSF plot showing differences between the simulations ![Following simulation, residue-level flexibility was assessed using RMSF analysis. The plot compares the unmodified MDH2 model (blue) to the phosphomimetic variant (red). Increased fluctuations are observed in the variant around residue 49—the site of the substitution—indicating greater mobility at the dimer interface. Additional differences are seen near residues 300 and 400, regions corresponding to loop segments that may be sensitive to conformational shifts. These changes suggest that introducing a negative charge at the interface alters the dynamic behavior of regions distant from the modification.](images/rmsfplot.png)

4.  Annotated plots of pKa for the key amino acids ![Predicted pKa values for His176 were compared between the unmodified and phosphomimetic models. In the unmodified enzyme, His176 showed a pKa near 7.0, indicating it would likely be protonated at physiological pH. In the variant, the pKa dropped below 5.0, suggesting a shift toward the deprotonated form. This change reflects altered electrostatics near the active site, potentially impacting catalytic function.](images/pkas.png)
